# Boucle - Django CRUD App 🪡

This is a CRUD Django app based on a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/zBbifWzjiPUECARx3JdwNc/Remedios-Landify?node-id=0%3A1">prototype</a> designed by me 🦄.

## Comments 🎙
In order to run this application is important to run it using the command `python3 manage.py runsslserver`. The app can be accessed on localhost with the url: `https://localhost:8000/` (This is the only valid OAuth Redirect URI until now).
